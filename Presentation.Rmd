## PROJECT CONTEXT 

**Motivation:** In scientific and medical research, accurate and reliable analysis of cell images can be crucial for understanding cellular structures & functions, diagnosing diseases, & developing new treatments. However, cell images can be affected by various factors leading to errors in image analysis & classification. 


**Robustness:** refers to the ability of an image analysis model or algorithm to maintain accurate & reliable results even in the presence of variations, noise, artifacts, or other disturbances in the input images. 


**Project Questions:**
- Q1: Investigating how the model's performance & robustness vary with different types & levels of noise levels, image resolution, & image artifacts. 

- Q2: How can data augmentation be used to improve the robustness of the model to variations in input image quality?
