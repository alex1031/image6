## PROJECT CONTEXT 

**Motivation:** Developing a robust computer vision tool, since cell images can be affected by various factors leading to errors in image analysis & classification (RÄ…czkowski et al., 2019). 


**Robustness:** refers to the ability of an image analysis model to maintain reliable results even in the presence of variations in the input images (Drenkow et al., n.d.). 


**Project Questions:**
- Q1: Investigating how the model's performance & robustness vary with different types & levels of noise levels, image resolution, & image artifacts. 

- Q2: How can data augmentation be used to improve the robustness of the model to variations in input image quality?

## Choice of Data Augmentations

Data augmentation is a technique used to help reduce over-fitting (Shorten & Khoshgoftaar, 2019). 

Three data augmentation factors:

- noise

- rotation

- resolution
